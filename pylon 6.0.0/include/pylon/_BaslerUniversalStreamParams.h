        \brief Port to which the stream grabber sends all stream data - Applies to: GigE

        
        
            The camera will send all stream data to this port. If you manually enter a port
            number, it is highly recommended not to choose a port from the ephemeral port
            range of the operating system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeral_port)
            in order to avoid port collisions.

            <b>Port configuration:</b>
            <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Unicast</b><br>
                The port is determined automatically.
                Manually choosing a port number might be useful for certain firewall configurations.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Broadcast & Multicast</b><br>
                For each device reachable by a specific network interface, a unique, unused port number
                must be assigned. Be aware that the suggested default value might be already in use.
                Choose an unused port or 0=autoselect in that case. The controlling application and all 
                monitor applications must use the same port number. There is no autoselect feature
                availbale for monitor applications, i.e., monitor applications must not use the 0 value.
                For monitor applications it is convenient to use the 'UseCameraConfig' value for the 
                'TransmissionType' feature instead. For more details see the 'TransmissionType' feature.
            </li>

        \brief Enables the packet resend mechanism - Applies to: GigE

        
        
        An image frame consists of n numbers of packets. Each packet has a header consisting of a 24-bit packet ID. 
        This packet ID increases with each packet sent, and makes it possible for the receiving end to know if a 
        particular packet has been lost during the transfer. If 'ResendPacketMechanism' is enabled, and the receiving
        end notices a lost packet, it will request the other side (e.g. the camera) to send the lost packet again.
        If enabled, the 'ResendPacketMechanism' can cause delays in the timing because the sending end will resend 
        the lost packet. If disabled, image data packet(s) can get lost which results in an incomplete received frame.
        You have to weigh the disadvantages and advantages for your special application to decide whether to enable 
        or disable this command.<br><br>

        <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Default (Unicast)</b><br>
            The camera sends stream data to a single controlling application. Other devices cannot
            receive the stream data.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b>Broadcast</b><br>
            The camera sends the stream data to all devices on the network. The application which 
            starts/stops the acquisition is called the controlling application. Other applications
            can receive the stream data. These applications are called monitor applications, because 
            they open the camera in read-only mode. This implies that monitor applications cannot 
            change the camera configuration and they cannot start/stop the image acquisition.
            However, monitor applications can request resend requests for lost stream data packets.
            <br><br>
            Attention: Broadcasting the stream data packets uses a high amount of network bandwidth 
                       because the stream data packets are forwarded to all devices attached to the 
                       network, even if they are not interested in receiving stream data.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b>Multicast</b><br>
            Multicasting is very similar to broadcasting. The main advantage of multicasting is that 
            multicasting saves network bandwidth, because the image data stream is only sent to those 
            devices that are interested in receiving the data. To achieve this, the camera sends image 
            data streams to members of a multicast group only. A multicast group is defined by an IP 
            address taken from the multicast address range (224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255). 
            <br><br>
            Every device that wants to receive a multicast data stream has to be a member of a multicast 
            group. A member of a specific multicast group only receives data destinated for this group.
            Data for other groups is not received. Usually network adapters and switches are able to filter
            the data efficently on hardware level (layer-2 packet filtering). 
            <br><br>
            When multicasting is enabled for pylon, pylon automatically takes care of joining and leaving 
            the multicast groups defined by the destination IP address. Keep in mind that some addresses
            from the multicast address range are reserved for general purposes. The address range from
            239.255.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 is assigned by RFC 2365 as a locally administered address space.
            Use one of these addresses if you are not sure.
            <br><br>
            On protocol level multicasting involves a so-called IGMP message (IGMP = Internet Group Management Protocol).
            To benefit from multicasting, managed network switches should be used. These managed network 
            switches support the IGMP protocol. Managed network switches supporting the IGMP protocol
            will forward multicast packets only if there is a connected device that has joined the
            corresponding multicast group. If the switch does not support the IGMP protocol, multicast
            is equivalent to broadcasting.
            <br><br>
            Recommendation:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each camera should stream to a different multicast group.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Streaming to different multicast groups reduces the CPU load and saves network bandwidth 
                    if the network switches supports the IGMP protocol.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>        
        <li>
            <b>Use camera configuration</b><br>
            This setting is only available if the application has opened the device in monitor mode. If 
            the controlling application has already configured the camera stream channel and has possibly 
            started the acquisition, the monitor application can read all required configuration data 
            from the camera. Additional configuration is not required. This setting can only be used if 
            the controlling application has established the stream channel (by opening a pylon stream 
            grabber object), and the monitor application is started afterwards.
            <br><br>
            Note, when using broadcast and multicast configurations: When there is more than one camera 
            device reachable by one network interface, make sure that for each camera a different port
            number must be assigned. For assigning port numbers, see the 'DestinationPort' feature.
        </li>
